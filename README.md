## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (or download source code):


2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
- Windows CMD:
  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```
- PowerShell:
  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
- macOS/Linux:
  ```

  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```

4. **Add your API key(s) in a `.env` file at the project root:**
    ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```
   
> **Important:** Keep `.env` secret and never commit it to source control.
